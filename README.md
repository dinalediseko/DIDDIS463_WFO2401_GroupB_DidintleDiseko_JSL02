# Learning Reflections README

## Overview
The task involved debugging the existing JavaScript code to prevent duplicate entries in the fitness goal list.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

- **Debugging JavaScript**: I successfully identified the source of the issue in the JavaScript code. By carefully examining the code logic, particularly in the `addNewGoal()` function, I pinpointing the necessary modifications to prevent duplicate entries in the goal list effectively.

- **Error Handling**: I implemented error handling mechanisms to prevent duplicate goals from being added to the list by displaying an alert message when a duplicate goal is detected

### Challenges Faced

- **Function Complexity**: Making a function to detect duplicate goals while considering other cases was a challenge. I encountered scenarios where the same goal could be represented differently (e.g., with varying capitalization or spacing).

### Areas for Improvement

- **Optimization**: While the implemented solution effectively prevents duplicate goals, there may be opportunities to optimize the code further.

### Overall Learning Experience

I was able to deepen my understanding of JavaScript debugging technique.
